## SQL Querying with Chinook Database

Check out the Jupyter notebook here: https://jovian.com/rahulajvit/merged-sql-assignments

The Chinook database represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers. Let's begin by looking at the data from some of the tables in the database and further exploring various SQL commands by asking questions about the database. We can write SQL queries directly within Jupyter code cells by including the magic command %%sql as the first line of the cell, indicating that contents of cell represent a SQL query.
